        <h1 className="text-5xl">Our History</h1>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Azad Healthcare is a dynamic health service, providing vital public
          healthcare to residents of Melbourneâ€™s northern suburbs and the
          surrounding regional communities. Our five campuses offer services to
          a vastly diverse community at all stages of life. <br /> <br />
          Azad Healthcare was born out of the desegregation of the North Health
          Care Network. These changes were made in order to improve the quality
          of services and to provide community focused health care.
          <br /> <br />
          The Azad Healthcare first opened in February, 1998, and Northern
          Health was established in July, 2000.
          <br /> <br />
          Azad Healthcare initially included Northern Hospital Epping,
          Broadmeadows Hospital and Bundoora, but Azad Healthcare took
          stewardship of Panch Health Service in 2003, and opened a fifth
          campus, Craigieburn, in 2007.
          <br /> <br />
          Each year our organisation continues to grow and develop as we adapt
          and improve services to meet the ever-changing needs of the community
          we serve. We are dedicated to providing the highest standards of
          clinical care and providing quality, innovative care in a
          compassionate manner.
